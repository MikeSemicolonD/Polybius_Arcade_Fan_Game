# Virtual Polybius Arcade Fan Game

## Description:
  A working Polybius Arcade game you can virutally walk up to and play. (Works with Unity 2018.2.0f2)

## Implementation Directions:
  You should be able to launch the project, go into 'SampleScene' and have it work.
The only think you need to be concerned about is linking your FPS controller to the arcade so it can interact with it.
The FPS controller it comes with is basically enough to get the job done.

## Controls:
  * WASD to move around. (Both FPS Mode and Arcade Mode)
  * E to interact with the machine. (FPS Mode)
  * SPACE to shoot. (Arcade Mode)
  * ENTER to input a coin into the machine. (Arcade Mode)

## Note:
  Uses sound effects from the SINNESLOSCHEN Polybius Fan Game.

## Another Note:
  The arcade should be limited to two specific rotations, otherwise the arcade machine won't display anything.
